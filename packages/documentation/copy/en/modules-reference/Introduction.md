This document is divided into four sections:

1. The first section develops the [**theory**](/docs/handbook/modules/theory.html) behind how TypeScript approaches modules. If you want to be able to write the correct module-related compiler options for any situation, reason about how to integrate TypeScript with other tools, or understand how TypeScript processes dependency packages, this is the place to start. While there are guides and reference pages on these topics, building an understanding of these fundamentals will make reading the guides easier, and give you a mental framework for dealing with real-world problems not specifically covered here.
2. The [**guides**](/docs/handbook/modules/guides/choosing-compiler-options.html) show how to accomplish specific real-world tasks, starting with picking the right compilation settings for a new project. The guides are a good place to start both for beginners who want to get up and running as quickly as possible and for experts who already have a good grasp of the theory but want concrete guidance on a complicated task.
3. The [**reference**](/docs/handbook/modules/reference.html) section provides a more detailed look at the syntaxes and configurations presented in previous sections.
4. The [**appendices**](/docs/handbook/modules/appendices/esm-cjs-interop.html) cover complicated topics that deserve additional explanation in more detail than the theory or reference sections allow.
