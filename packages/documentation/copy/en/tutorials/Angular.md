Angular is a modern framework built entirely in TypeScript, and as a result, using TypeScript with Angular provides a seamless experience.

The Angular documentation not only supports TypeScript as a first-class citizen, but uses it as its primary language.
With this in mind, [Angular's site](https://angular.io) will always be the most up-to-date reference for using Angular with TypeScript.

Check out the [quick start guide here](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html) to start learning Angular now!
